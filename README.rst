mqttwarn - subscribe to MQTT topics and notify pluggable services.


Description
===========

*mqttwarn* subscribes to any number of MQTT topics and publishes received
payloads to one or more notification services after optionally applying
sophisticated transformations.

A picture says a thousand words.

Notification service coverage
=============================

*mqttwarn* comes with **over 70 notification handler plugins**, covering a
wide range of notification services and is very open to further contributions.
You can enjoy the alphabetical list of plugins on the `mqttwarn notifier
catalog`_ page.

On top of that, it integrates with the excellent `Apprise`_ notification
library. `Apprise notification services`_ has a complete list of the **80+
notification services** supported by Apprise.



*************
Documentation
*************

The `mqttwarn documentation`_ is the right place to read all about *mqttwarn*'s
features and integrations, and how you can leverage all its framework components
for building custom applications. Its service plugins can be inspected on the
`mqttwarn notifier catalog`_ page.


************
Installation
************

Using pip
=========

Synopsis::

    pip install --upgrade mqttwarn

You can also add support for a specific service plugin::

    pip install --upgrade 'mqttwarn[xmpp]'

You can also add support for multiple services, all at once::

    pip install --upgrade 'mqttwarn[apprise,asterisk,nsca,desktopnotify,tootpaste,xmpp]'

See also: `Installing mqttwarn with pip`_.

OCI container image
===================

For running ``mqttwarn`` on a container infrastructure like Docker or
Kubernetes, corresponding images are automatically published to the
GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

- ``ghcr.io/mqtt-tools/mqttwarn-standard:latest``
- ``ghcr.io/mqtt-tools/mqttwarn-full:latest``

To learn more about this topic, please follow up reading the `Using the OCI image
with Docker or Podman`_ documentation section.


*************
Configuration
*************

In order to learn how to configure mqttwarn, please head over to the documentation
section about the `mqttwarn configuration`_.


*****
Usage
*****

Interactive service
===================
Just launch ``mqttwarn``::

    # Run mqttwarn
    mqttwarn


To supply a different configuration file or log file, optionally use::

    # Define configuration file
    export MQTTWARNINI=/etc/mqttwarn/acme.ini

    # Define log file
    export MQTTWARNLOG=/var/log/mqttwarn.log

    # Run mqttwarn
    mqttwarn

System daemon
=============

There are different ways to run mqttwarn as a system daemon. There are examples
for systemd, traditional init, OpenRC, and Supervisor_ in the ``etc`` directory
of this repository, for example `supervisor.ini`_ (Supervisor) and
`mqttwarn.service`_ (systemd).

Standalone
==========

In order to directly invoke notification plugins from custom programs, or for
debugging them, see `Running notification plugins standalone`_.

Development sandbox
===================

For hacking on mqttwarn, please install it in development mode, using a
`mqttwarn development sandbox`_ installation.
