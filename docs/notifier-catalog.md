### `alexa-notify-me`

The `alexa-notify-me` service implements a gateway to make Alexa notifications using the Notify-Me voice app.
https://www.thomptronics.com/about/notify-me

```ini

[config:alexa-notify-me]
targets = {
	'account1' : [ 'Access Code' ]
  }

[alexa/notify]
targets = alexa-notify-me:account1
```

The access code is emailed to the user upon setup of Notify-Me.

Also see examples for Amazon Alexa.


### `amqp`

The `amqp` service basically implements an MQTT to AMQP gateway which is a little bit
overkill as, say, RabbitMQ already has a pretty versatile MQTT plugin. The that as it
may, the configuration is as follows:

```ini
[config:amqp]
uri     =  'amqp://user:password@localhost:5672/'
targets = {
    'test01'     : [ 'name_of_exchange',    'routing_key' ],
    }
```

The exchange specified in the target configuration must exist prior to using this
target.

Requires: [Puka](https://github.com/majek/puka/) (`pip install puka`)

### `apns`

The `apns` service interacts with the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and
is a bit special, and one of _mqttwarn_'s more complex services. It requires an 
X.509 certificate and a key, which are typically available to developers only.

The following discussion assumes one of these payloads published via MQTT:

```json
{"alert": "Vehicle moved" }
```

```json
{"alert": "Vehicle moved", "custom" : { "tid": "C2" }}
```

In both cases, the message "Vehicle moved" will be displayed in the notification
of the iOS device. The second example depends on the app which receives the
notification. This custom data is per-app. This example app uses the custom
data to show a button:

![APNS notification](assets/apns.png)

This is the configuration we'll discuss.

```ini
[defaults]
hostname  = 'localhost'
port      = 1883
functions = 'myfuncs'

launch	 = apns

[config:apns]
targets = {
                 # path to cert in PEM format   # key in PEM format
    'prod'     : ['/path/to/prod.crt',          '/path/to/prod.key'],
    }

[test/token/+]
targets = apns
alldata = apnsdata()
format  = {alert}
```

Certificate and key files are in PEM format, and the key file must *not* be
password-protected.

If you need to extract them from a PKCS#12 file, run:
```
openssl pkcs12 -in apns-CTRL.p12 -nocerts -nodes | openssl rsa > prod.key
openssl pkcs12 -in apns-CTRL.p12 -clcerts -nokeys > xxxx
```
Then, copy/paste from `xxxx` the sandbox or production certificate into `prod.crt`.

The _myfuncs_ function `apnsdata()` extracts the last part of the topic into
`apns_token`, the hex token for the target device, which is required within the
`apns` service.

```python
def apnsdata(topic, data, srv=None):
    return dict(apns_token = topic.split('/')[-1])
```

Publishing to topic `test/token/380757b117f15a46dff2bd0be1d57929c34124dacb28d346dedb14d3464325e5`
will emit the APNS notification to the specified device.

This module depends on the Python [apns](https://pypi.org/project/apns/) package.


### `apprise_about`

The `apprise_single` and `apprise_multi` service plugins interact with the
[Apprise] Python library, which in turn can talk to a plethora of popular
notification services:

Apprise API, AWS SES, AWS SNS, Bark, BulkSMS, Boxcar, ClickSend, DAPNET,
DingTalk, Discord, E-Mail, Emby, Faast, FCM, Flock, Gitter, Google Chat,
Gotify, Growl, Guilded, Home Assistant, IFTTT, Join, Kavenegar, Kodi, Kumulos,
LaMetric, Line, MacOSX, Mailgun, Mattermost, Matrix, Microsoft Windows,
Mastodon, Microsoft Teams, MessageBird, MQTT, MSG91, MyAndroid, Nexmo,
Nextcloud, NextcloudTalk, Notica, Notifico, ntfy, Office365, OneSignal,
Opsgenie, PagerDuty, ParsePlatform, PopcornNotify, Prowl, PushBullet,
Pushjet, Pushover, Pushsafer, Reddit, Rocket.Chat, SendGrid, ServerChan, Signal,
SimplePush, Sinch, Slack, SMSEagle, SMTP2Go, Spontit, SparkPost, Super Toasty,
Streamlabs, Stride, Syslog, Techulus Push, Telegram, Twilio, Twitter, Twist,
XBMC, Vonage, Webex Teams.

[Apprise Notification Services] has a complete list and documentation of the
80+ notification services supported by Apprise.

Notification services are addressed by URL, see [Apprise URL Basics].
Please consult the [Apprise documentation] about more details.

Apprise notification plugins obtain different kinds of configuration or
template arguments. mqttwarn supports propagating them from either the
``baseuri`` configuration setting, or from its data dictionary to the Apprise
plugin invocation.

So, for example, you can propagate parameters to the [Apprise JSON HTTP POST
Notifications plugin] by either pre-setting them as URL query parameters, like
```
json://localhost/?:sound=oceanwave
```
or by submitting them within a JSON-formatted MQTT message, like
```json
{":sound": "oceanwave", "tags": "foo,bar", "click": "https://httpbin.org/headers"}
```

### `apprise_single`

This variant can publish messages to a single Apprise plugin by URL.

The following configuration snippet example expects a payload like this to be
published to the MQTT broker:
```bash
echo '{"device": "foobar", "name": "temperature", "number": 42.42}' | mosquitto_pub -t 'apprise/single/foo' -l
```

This is an example configuration snippet to submit notifications using
Apprise to E-Mail, an HTTP endpoint, and a Discord channel.

```ini
[defaults]
launch    = apprise-mail, apprise-json, apprise-discord

[config:apprise-mail]
; Dispatch message as e-mail.
; https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_email
module   = 'apprise_single'
baseuri  = 'mailtos://smtp_username:smtp_password@mail.example.org'
sender   = 'monitoring@example.org'
sender_name = 'Example Monitoring'
targets  = {
    'demo' : ['foo@example.org', 'bar@example.org'],
    }

[config:apprise-json]
; Dispatch message to HTTP endpoint, in JSON format.
; https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_Custom_JSON
module   = 'apprise_single'
baseuri  = 'json://localhost:1234/mqtthook'

[config:apprise-discord]
; Dispatch message to Discord channel, via Webhook.
; https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_discord
; https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook
; discord://{WebhookID}/{WebhookToken}/
module   = 'apprise_single'
baseuri  = 'discord://4174216298/JHMHI8qBe7bk2ZwO5U711o3dV_js'

[apprise-single-test]
topic    = apprise/single/#
targets  = apprise-mail:demo, apprise-json, apprise-discord
format   = Alarm from {device}: {payload}
title    = Alarm from {device}
```

In order to mention people within messages to Discord, you will need to use
their numerical user identifiers like `mosquitto_pub -m "hello <@user_id> again"`.
This is **not** their text username. A special case is mentioning everyone in a
channel, which works like `-m "hello @everyone again"`.


### `apprise_multi`

The idea behind this variant is to publish messages to different Apprise
plugins within a single configuration snippet, containing multiple recipients
at different notification services.

The following configuration snippet example expects a payload like this to be
published to the MQTT broker:
```bash
echo '{"device": "foobar", "name": "temperature", "number": 42.42}' | mosquitto_pub -t 'apprise/multi/foo' -l
```

```ini
[defaults]
launch    = apprise-multi

[config:apprise-multi]
; Dispatch message to multiple Apprise plugins.
module   = 'apprise_multi'
targets = {
   'demo-http'        : [ { 'baseuri':  'json://localhost:1234/mqtthook' }, { 'baseuri':  'json://daq.example.org:5555/foobar' } ],
   'demo-discord'     : [ { 'baseuri':  'discord://4174216298/JHMHI8qBe7bk2ZwO5U711o3dV_js' } ],
   'demo-mailto'      : [ {
          'baseuri':  'mailtos://smtp_username:smtp_password@mail.example.org',
          'recipients': ['foo@example.org', 'bar@example.org'],
          'sender': 'monitoring@example.org',
          'sender_name': 'Example Monitoring',
          } ],
   }

[apprise-multi-test]
topic    = apprise/multi/#
targets  = apprise-multi:demo-http, apprise-multi:demo-discord, apprise-multi:demo-mailto
format   = Alarm from {device}: {payload}
title    = Alarm from {device}
```


### `asterisk`

The `asterisk` service will make a VOIP conference between the number and the extension
(in defined context). Also, it sends the message as variable to the extension, so you can
'speak' to it. Configuration is similar as with the [FreeSWITCH](#freeswitch) service,
but this service uses the [Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI)].

The plugin author strongly recommends you use AMI only in trusted networks.

```ini
[config:asterisk]
host     = 'localhost'
port     = 5038
username = 'mqttwarn'
password = '<AMI password>'
extension = 2222
context = 'default'
targets  = {
    'user'    : ['SIP/avaya/', '0123456789']
          }
```

Requires

* [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) with configured AMI interface (manager.conf)
* pyst2 -  powerful Python abstraction of the various Asterisk APIs (pip install pyst2)

[Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI)]: https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4817239


### `autoremote`

The `autoremote` service forwards messages from desired topics to autoremote clients.
```ini
[config:autoremote]
targets = {
    'conv2' : [ 'ApiKey', 'Password', 'Target', 'Group', 'TTL' ]
  }

[autoremote/user]
targets = autoremote:conv2
```

Any messages published to autoremote/user would be sent the autoremote client
designated to the ApiKey provided. The "sender" variable of autoremote is equal to
the topic address.

https://joaoapps.com/autoremote/


### `azure_iot`

This service is for [Microsoft Azure IoT Hub].

The configuration requires the name of the IoT Hub, optionally a QoS level
(default 0), and one or more targets. Each target defines which device to
impersonate when sending the message.

```ini
[config:azure_iot]
iothubname = 'MyIoTHub'
qos = 1
targets = {
               # device id   # sas token
    'test' : [ 'mqttwarn',   'SharedAccessSignature sr=...' ]
  }
```

Message delivery is performed using the MQTT protocol, observing the Azure IoT
Hub requirements.

[Microsoft Azure IoT Hub]: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-hub/


### `carbon`

A [Carbon daemon], as part of a [Graphite] system, listens on the network for
time-series data. The `carbon` service sends a metric to a Carbon-enabled server
over TCP, using one of the [Carbon protocols].

```ini
[config:carbon]
targets = {
        'c1' : [ '172.16.153.110', 2003 ],
  }

[c/#]
targets = carbon:c1
```

In this configuration, all messages published to `c/#` would be forwarded to
the Carbon server at the specified IP address and TCP port number.

The topic name is translated into a Carbon _metric_ name by replacing slashes
by periods. A timestamp is appended to the message automatically.

For example, publishing this:

```
mosquitto_pub -t c/temp/arduino -m 12
```

would result in the value `12` being used as the value for the Carbon metric
`c.temp.arduino`. The published payload may contain up to three parts separated
by white-space.

1. The carbon metric name, dot-separated (e.g. `room.temperature`)
   If this is omitted, the MQTT topic name will be used as described above.
2. The integer value for the metric.
3. An integer timestamp (UNIX epoch time), which defaults to "now".

In other words, the following payloads are valid:

```
15                          just the value (metric name will be MQTT topic)
room.living 15              metric name and value
room.living 15 1405014635   metric name, value, and timestamp
```

### `celery`

[Celery] is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast
amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to
maintain such a system. It’s a task queue with focus on real-time processing,
while also supporting task scheduling.

The `celery` service sends messages to celery which celery workers can consume.

```ini
[config:celery]
broker_url = 'redis://localhost:6379/5'
app_name = 'celery'
celery_serializer = 'json'
targets = {
   'hello': [
      {
        'task': 'myapp.hello',
        'message_format': 'json'
        }
      ],
  }

[hello/#]
targets = celery:hello
```
Broker URL can be any broker supported by celery. Celery serializer is usually json or pickle. Json is recommended for security.
Targets are selected by task name. Message_format can be either "json" or "text". If it is json, the message will be sent as a json payload rather than a string.
In this configuration, all messages that match hello/ will be sent to the celery task "myapp.hello". The first argument of the celery task will be the message from mqtt.

[Celery]: https://docs.celeryq.dev/


### `chromecast`

The `chromecast` service sends messages via Text To Speach (TTS) to Chromecast devices, including Google Home Speakers.

```ini
# Don't fogert to set launch = ..., chromecast
[config:chromecast]
; Chromecast devices, including Google Home Speakers
#baseuri  = 'http://my.personal.server:5000/translate_tts?srttss_mimetype=audio/wav&'
#mimetype = 'audio/wav'
targets  = {
    'speaker' : ['Living Room'],
    }

# Command line test
# mqttwarn --plugin=chromecast --options='{"message": "Hello world", "addrs": ["Living Room"]}'
# echo 'Hello world' | mosquitto_pub -t 'chromecast/say' -l
# echo '{"message": "Hello world", "addrs": ["Living Room"]}' | mosquitto_pub -t 'chromecast/say' -l
[chromecast/say]
targets = chromecast:speaker

```
Address targets are the registered device friendly name. In this example, "Living Room".
The TTS server defaults to Google translate (and English).
A custom server URL can be used for local TTS assuming the server honors Google Syntax arguments (for example https://github.com/clach04/srttss) via baseuri (and mimetype if the server does not server mp3 format files).

Requires pychromecast to be installed via::

    pip install pychromecast


### `dbus`

The `dbus` service sends a message over [D-Bus] to the user's desktop.
So far, it has only been tested with Gnome3.

```ini
[config:dbus]
targets = {
    'warn' : [ 'Warning' ],
    'note' : [ 'Note' ]
    }
```

This module requires the [Python dbus bindings].

[D-Bus]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus
[Python dbus bindings]: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings/#Python


### `desktopnotify`

It invokes desktop notifications, using the [desktop-notifier] package.

```ini
[config:desktopnotify]
; title = Optional title; topic if not set
; sound = Default True [False] - Play sound? 
targets = {
  'anything' : [ ],
  }
```
If the MQTT message is a JSON object, it will populate the notification title and message accordingly.
```json
{
	"title" : "YourTitle",
	"message": "YourMessage"
}
```

[desktop-notifier]: https://github.com/samschott/desktop-notifier


### `dnsupdate`

The `dnsupdate` service updates an authoritative DNS server via [RFC 2136] DNS Updates.
Consider the following configuration:

```ini
[config:dnsupdate]
dns_nameserver = '127.0.0.2'
dns_keyname= 'mqttwarn-auth'
dns_keyblob= 'kQNwTJ ... evi2DqP5UA=='
targets = {
   #target             DNS-Zone      DNS domain              TTL   type
   'temp'         :  [ 'foo.aa.',     'temperature.foo.aa.', 300, 'TXT'   ],
   'addr'         :  [ 'foo.aa.',     'www.foo.aa.',         60,  'A'   ],
  }

[test/temp]
targets = log:info, dnsupdate:temp
format = Current temperature: {payload}C

[test/a]
targets = log:info, dnsupdate:addr
format = {payload}
```

- `dns_nameserver` is the address of the authoritative server the update should be sent
  to, using a TCP update.
- `dns_keyname` and `dns_keyblob` are the TSIG key names and base64-representation of
  the key respectively. These can be created with either of those commands:

  ```
  ldns-keygen  -a hmac-sha256 -b 256 keyname
  dnssec-keygen -n HOST -a HMAC-SHA256 -b 256 keyname
  ```

  Here, `keyname` is the name then added to `dns_keyname` (in this example: `mqttwarn-auth`).

Supposing a BIND DNS server was configured to allow updates, you would then configure it
as follows:

```
key "mqttwarn-auth" {
  algorithm hmac-sha256;
  secret "kQNwTJ ... evi2DqP5UA==";
};

...
zone "foo.aa" in {
   type master;
   file "keytest/foo.aa";
   update-policy {
      grant mqttwarn-auth. zonesub ANY;
   };
};
```

For the `test/temp` topic, a pub and the resulting DNS query:

```
$ mosquitto_pub -t test/temp -m 42'
$ dig @127.0.0.2 +noall +answer temperature.foo.aa txt
temperature.foo.aa. 300 IN  TXT "Current temperature: 42C"
```

The `test/a` topic expects an address:

```
$ mosquitto_pub -t test/a -m 172.16.153.44
$ dig @127.0.0.2 +short www.foo.aa
172.16.153.44
```

Ensure you watch both mqttwarn's logfile and the log of your authoritative name
server, in order to follow what is going on.
```
client 127.0.0.2#52786/key mqttwarn-auth: view internal: updating zone 'foo.aa/IN': adding an RR at 'www.foo.aa' A 172.16.153.44
```

This module is based on the [dnspython] package.

[RFC 2136]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2136


### `emoncms`

The `emoncms` service sends a numerical payload to an [EmonCMS] instance.
EmonCMS is a powerful open-source application for processing, logging and
visualising energy, temperature and other environmental data.

The application can be deployed on your premises, or you can upload your readings
to their server for viewing and monitoring within the scope of your account.

By specifying the node id and input name in the mqttwarn target, you can split
different feeds into different nodes, and give each one a human-readable name,
in order to identify them in EmonCMS.

```ini
[config:emoncms]
# URL of EmonCMS server.
url     = "https://emoncms.example.org/emoncms"
# API key generated by the EmonCMS server.
apikey  = ""
timeout = 5
targets = {
    'usage'  : [ 1, 'usage' ],  # [ <nodeid>, <name> ]
    'solar'  : [ 1, 'solar' ]
    }
```

[EmonCMS]: https://emoncms.org/


{#execute}
### `execute`

The `execute` target launches the specified program and its arguments. It is similar
to `pipe` but it doesn't open a pipe to the program.

Example use cases are, for example, IoT buttons, which publish a message when they are
pushed, in order to execute an external program. It is also a light version of [mqtt-launcher].

```ini
[config:execute]
targets = {
             # argv0 .....
   'touch' : [ 'touch', '/tmp/executed' ],
   'cat'   : [ 'cat', '[TEXT]' ]
   }
```

To pass the published data (text) to the command, use `[TEXT]` which then gets replaced.
This can also be configured with the `text_replace` parameter.

Note, that for each message targeted to the `execute` service, a new process is
spawned (fork/exec), so it is quite "expensive".

:::{seealso}
A real-world example how this feature can be used is demonstrated at [](#mqtt-media-player).
:::

[mqtt-launcher]: https://github.com/jpmens/mqtt-launcher


### `fbchat`

Notification of one [Facebook](https://facebook.com) account requires an account.
For now, this is only done for messaging from one account to another.

Upon configuring this service's targets, make sure the three (3) elements of the
list are in the order specified!

```ini
[config:fbchat]
targets = {
  'janejol'   :  [ 'vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv',                              # username sending message
                   'wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww',          # username's password (sending message)
                   'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'  # destination account (receiving message)
                  ]
   }
```

Requires:
* A Facebook account
* [python-fbchat](https://github.com/yakhira/fbchat)


### `file`

The `file` service can be used for logging incoming topics, archiving, etc.
Each message is written to a path specified in the target address descriptor,
as a list. Note that by default, files are opened for appending, and then
closed on each notification.

Supposing we wish to archive all messages received on the MQTT topic `arch/#`
to a file `/data/arch`, we could configure the following:

```ini
[config:file]
append_newline = True
overwrite = False
targets = {
    'log-me'    : ['/data/arch']
   }
```

#### Options

If `append_newline` is `True`, a newline character is unconditionally appended
to the string written to the file.
 
If `overwrite` is `True`, the file is opened for truncation upon writing, i.e.
the file will contain the last message only.

Both parameters can also be specified on a per-file basis, where per-item
parameters take precedence over global parameters. In order to do that,
the corresponding configuration snippet would look like this:
```ini
[config:file]
targets = {
    'log-me'    : {'path': '/data/arch', 'append_newline': True, 'overwrite': False},
   }
```

Although the `decode_utf8` service option acts on a different spot, it makes
sense to outline how to forward and store MQTT message payloads to files 1:1.
It also works on binary files, for example images.

```ini

### `freeswitch`

The `freeswitch` service will make a VOIP call to the number specified in your
target, using [FreeSWITCH], and 'speak' the message using the TTS service you
specify.

Each target includes the gateway to use, as well as the number/extension to call,
so you can make internal calls directly to an extension, or call any external number
using your external gateway.

In order to use this service, you will need to enable the [FreeSWITCH XML RPC API].

You need to provide a TTS URL to perform the text-to-speech conversion of your message
to an announcement. This can be an online service like VoiceRSS, the [Google Translate
API], or another local TTS service you are using.

```ini
[config:freeswitch]
host      = 'localhost'
port      = 8050
username  = 'freeswitch'
password  = '<xml_rpc_password>'
ttsurl    = 'translate.google.com/translate_tts?'
ttsparams = { 'tl': 'en', 'ie': 'UTF-8', 'client': 'mqttwarn', 'q': '{payload}' }
targets   = {
    'mobile'    : ['sofia/gateway/domain/', '0123456789']
    }
```

This module requires:
* [FreeSWITCH]
* Internet connection for Google Translate API

:::{note}
Only the first 100 chars of the message will be announced, because this is the
maximum length supported by the Google Translate API.

### `gss2`

The `gss2` service interacts directly with a Google Docs Spreadsheet. Each message
can be written to a row in a selected worksheet.

Each target has two parameters.

1. The spreadsheet URL. You can copy the URL from your browser that shows the spreadsheet.
2. The name of the worksheet. Try `Sheet1`.

```ini
[config:gss2]
client_secrets_filename = client_secrets.json
oauth2_code =
oauth2_storage_filename = oauth2.store
targets = {
    # spreadsheet_url                                          # worksheet_name
    'test': [ 'https://docs.google.com/spre...cdA-ik8uk/edit', 'Sheet1']
    # This target would be addressed as 'gss2:test'.
    }
```

:::{note}
It is important that the top row into your blank spreadsheet has column headings
that correspond to the values that represent your dictionary keys. If these column
headers are not available, or different from the dictionary keys, the new rows will
be empty.
:::

:::{note}
A Google Spreadsheet initially contains 100 or 1,000 empty rows. New rows added by 
`gss2` will be *below*, so you might want to delete those empty rows.
:::

This module requires:
* [google-api-python-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/)
  (`pip install google-api-python-client`)
* [gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread)
  (`pip install gspread`)

#### Setup OAuth2 with Google
`gss2` uses OAuth 2.0 authentication, please read the setup procedure documentation
carefully. Here is an overview how the authentication with Google works:

1. You obtain a `client_secrets.json` file from Google Developers Console.
1. You reference that file in the `client_secrets_filename` field and restart mqttwarn.
1. You grab an URL from the logs and visit that in your web browser.
1. You copy the resulting code to `mqttwarn.ini`, field `oauth2_code`
   and restart mqttwarn.
1. `gss2` stores the eventual credentials in the file you specified in
   field `oauth2_storage_filename`.
1. Everyone lives happily ever after. I hope you reach this point without
   severe technology burnout.
1. Technically, you could remove the code from field `oauth2_code`,
   but it does not harm to leave it there.

Now to the details of this process:
The contents of the file `client_secrets_filename` needs to be obtained by you as described
in the [Google API Client Library for Python Docs] on OAuth 2.0 for an Installed Application.
Unfortunately, [Google prohibits](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28109307/217001) developers
to publish their credentials as part of open source software. So you need to get the
credentials yourself.

To get them:

1. Log in to the Google Developers website from
   [here](https://developers.google.com/).
1. Follow the instructions in section `Creating application credentials` from
   the [OAuth 2.0 for Installed Applications](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/installed-app#creatingcred) chapter.
   You are looking for an `OAuth client ID`.
1. In the [Credentials screen of the API manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
   there is a download icon next to your new client ID. The downloaded
   file should be named something like `client_secret_664...json`.
1. Store that file near e.g. `mqttwarn.ini` and ensure the setting
   `client_secrets_filename` has the valid path name of it.

Then, you start with the `gss2` service enabled and with the `client_secrets_filename`
readable. Once an event is to be published, you will find an error in the logs with a
URL that you need to visit with a web browser that is logged into your Google account.
Google will offer you to accept access to Google Docs/Drive. Once you accept, you get
to copy a code that you need to paste into field `oauth2_code` and restart mqttwarn.

The file defined in `oauth2_storage_filename` needs to be missing or writable and will
be created or overwritten. Once OAuth credentials have been established (using the
`oauth2_code`), they are persisted in there.

#### Example

An [OwnTracks] MQTT message like
```
mosquitto_pub -t nn/ohoh -m '{"username": "jan", "device":"phone", "lat": "-33.8746097", "lon": "18.6292892", "batt": "94"}'
```

will turn into:

### `hangbot`

The hangbot service allows messages to be forwarded to a Google Hangouts account using hangoutsbot api plugin.
https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/API-Plugin

```ini
[config:hangbot]
targets = {
		 #URL		 #PORT	 #ApiKey	#Conversation ID
   'conv1'   : ['ServerAddress', 'Port', 'xxxxxxxxxxx', 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx']
  }
```


### `http`

The `http` service allows to invoke GET and POST requests to an HTTP service.

Each target has five parameters.

1. The HTTP method, one of `get` or `post`.
2. The URL, which is transformed if possible, while ignoring any transformation errors.
3. `None` or a dict of parameters. Each individual parameter value is transformed.
4. `None` or a list of username/password tuples e.g. `( 'username', 'password')`
5. `None` or `True`, to force the transformation of the third parameter to a JSON
   object, and to send the HTTP header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`,
   when using `post`.

```ini
[config:http]
timeout = 60

targets = {
                #method     #URL               # query params or None                              # list auth # Json
  'get1'    : [ "get",  "http://example.org?", { 'q': '{name}', 'isod' : '{_dtiso}', 'xx': 'yy' }, ('username', 'password') ],
  'post1'    : [ "post", "http://example.net", { 'q': '{name}', 'isod' : '{_dtiso}', 'xx': 'yy' }, None, True ]
  }
```

If you want to use the MQTT message content in the query parameters verbatim,
use `'{payload}'`.

:::{note}
Note that transforms in parameters must be quoted strings:

* Wrong: `'q' : {name}`
* Correct: `'q' : '{name}'`

As a special case, if the quoted parameter starts with an `@` character (e.g.
`'@name'`), it will not be formatted via `.format()`. Instead, `name` is taken
directly from the transformation data.
:::


### `icinga2`

This service is for the REST API in [Icinga2]. Icinga2 is an open source
monitoring system. Using this service, JSON payloads can be sent to your
Icinga2 server to indicate host/service states or passive check updates.

By default, the service will POST a `process-check-result` to your Icinga2
server with the following payload.
```
payload  = {
    'service'       : 'host-name!service-name',
    'check_source'  : 'check-source',
    'exit_status'   : priority,
    'plugin_output' : message
    }
```

Where the `host-name`, `service-name` and `check-source` come from the service
config (see below), the priority is the standard `mqttwarn` priority, either
hard coded or derived via a _function_, and the message is the payload arriving
at the MQTT topic.

NOTE: if `service-name` is None in the target config the payload will include
`'host' : 'host-name'` instead of the `'service'` entry, and can be used for
host checks.

However, it is possible to create your own payload by adding a custom format
function where you can specify a dict of key/value pairs and these will be
used to update the payload sent to Icinga2.

For example, we can add a custom function.
```
def icinga2_format(data, srv):
    icinga2_payload = {
        'exit_status'  : 0,
        'plugin_output': "OK: my-service is publishing",
        'service'      : "host.com!my-service",
        }

    return json.dumps(icinga2_payload)
```

This allows you to manipulate the status, output and service name by parsing
topic names and message payloads.

```ini
[config:icinga2]
host     = 'https://icingahost'
port     = 5665
username = 'api-username'
password = 'api-password'
cacert   = '<path-to-ca-cert>'
targets  = {
                        # host-name   service-name  check-source
    'host-check '    : [ 'host.com',  None,         'mqttwarn' ],
    'service-check ' : [ 'host.com',  'passive',    'mqttwarn' ],
    }
```

NOTE: `cacert` is optional but since `icinga2` is typically installed with a
self-signed certificate specifying the `icinga2` ca-cert will stop a load of
TLS certificate warnings when connecting to the REST API.

### `ifttt`

This service is for [IFTTT Webhooks integrations] to send the message as a payload
in value1. For example, to get notifications on your mobile devices.

```ini
[config:ifttt]
targets = {
    'warnme'   : [ '<api key>', '<event webhook>' ]
  }
```

[IFTTT Webhooks integrations]: https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks


### `ionic`

This service is for [Ionic]. Ionic framework allows easy development of HTML5 hybrid
mobile apps. This service can be used for pushing notifications to ionic hybrid apps
(Android, iOS, ...). Please read following for more details on Ionic:
[Ionic documentation] and [Ionic Push Notifications API].

You will get Ionic appid and Ionic appsecret (private key) after registering with
Ionic push service. And you will get device token(s) when app initiates push service
interaction.

Using this service, *plain texts* can be sent to one or many ionic apps. Each app
can in turn push to many devices.

#### Example

```ini
[config:ionic]
targets = {
  'anyappalias' : [ '<ionic app id>', '<ionic app secret>', '<device token 1>', '<device token 2>', '<device token N>']
  }
```

### `influxdb`

[InfluxDB]: https://influxdata.com/

This service provides a way for forwarding data to the time series database [InfluxDB].

You will need to install an instance of InfluxDB and create a new user. Then, create
a new database and give your user write permissions to that database.

You can then setup multiple *targets*, each of which is a different *measurement* in
your InfluxDB database.  Individual targets can override the default measurement,
retention policy, and/or precision.

Each time a value is received for an InfluxDB target, the value is sent to the
configured *measurement* with a *topic* tag matching the MQTT topic the data arrived
at.

The topic name is normalised by replacing `/` with `_`. So, a value arriving on
`sensor/kitchen/temperature` would be published to InfluxDB with a tag of
`topic=sensor_kitchen_temperature`.

This allows you to set up measurements with multiple time series streams, or have a
separate measurement for each stream.

Following is an ini example, showing the various connection properties for the
InfluxDB database, and some example target address descriptor configurations.
The retention policy (`rp`) and `precision` settings are optional, the default
InfluxDB retention policy (`autogen`) and precision (`ns` [nanosecond]) will be
used if not specified.

```ini
[config:influxdb]
# Protocol for connection to InfluxDB: http or https. Default: http
scheme    = 'https'
host      = 'influxdbhost'
port      = 8086

username  = 'username'
password  = 'password'
database  = 'mqttwarn'
# Retention Policy: optional (default: autogen)
rp        = 'retentionpolicy'
# Precision: optional (default: ns)
precision = 's'    # { ns, u, ms, s, m, h }
targets = {
                          # measurement
    'humidity'         : [ 'humidity' ],
    'temperature'      : [ 'temperature' ]
    }
```

Individual targets can override the default measurement, retention policy,
and/or precision:

```ini
[config:influxdb]
host      = 'influxdbhost'
port      = 8086
username  = 'username'
password  = 'password'
database  = 'mqttwarn'
rp        = 'retentionpolicy'
precision = 'ns'    # { ns, u, ms, s, m, h }
targets = {
                       # measurement (use database, rp, and precision specified above)
    'temperature'   : [ 'temperature' ],
                       # measurement,    database,   rp,     precision
    'disk'          : [ 'disk',          'servers',  'rp',   'h' ]
                       # measurement,    database   (default rp & precision)
    'cpu'           : [ 'cpu',           'servers' ],
                       # use default rp, but override database & precision:
    'alpha'         : [ 'alpha',         'metrics',  '',    's' ]
    }
```

InfluxDB tags and fields can be specified per topic using transformations. The
format string should not contain quotes, and should follow these examples.
:::{note}
The tag set (if any) should be listed first, comma-separated and without spaces,
followed by whitespace and then the field set (required, if format is used).
:::
```ini
[topic/one]
format = tagkey1=tagvalue1,tagkey2=tagvalue2  field=value
[topic/two]
format = field=value
```

The 'topic' tag is always set as described above.

Messages received matching the following config...
```ini
[environment/temperature/basement]
targets = influxdb:temperature
format = room=basement,entity=sensor2 temperature={payload}
```

... will be stored as:
```text
             (tag)    (tag)     (field)      (tag)
time         entity   room      temperature  topic
----         ------   ----      -----------  -----
{timestamp}  sensor2  basement  47.5         environment_temperature_basement
```

:::{attention}
This module will currently only work with InfluxDB 1.x. In order to make the leap
to InfluxDB 2.x, contributions to [Support for InfluxDB 2 #563] are very much
welcome.
:::

### `irccat`

The `irccat` target fires a message off to a listening [IRCcat] IRC bot, which is
a member on one or more IRC channels.

Each target has to be configured with the IP address, TCP port, and channel name,
of the particular _IRCcat_ instance it should target.

```ini
[config:irccat]
targets = {
             # address     port   channel
   'chan1': [ '127.0.0.1', 12345, '#testchan1' ],
  }
```

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                            |
| ------------- | :----: | -------------------------------------- |
| `priority`    |   O    | Colour: 0=black, 1=green, 2=red        |

The priority field can be used to indicate a message colour.

![irccat](assets/irccat.png)

[IRCcat]: https://github.com/RJ/irccat


### `linuxnotify`
The `linuxnotify` service is used to display notifications on a running desktop
environment (only tested with Gnome3).

```ini
[config:linuxnotify]
targets = {
    'warn' : [ 'Warning' ]
    }
```

![linuxnotify](assets/linuxnotify.png)

This module requires:
- Gnome3 as desktop environment
- `gobject-introspection` Python bindings


### `log`

The `log` service allows you to forward messages to the logging system of _mqttwarn_.
In turn, messages directed at `log` will land in _mqttwarn_'s log file.

```ini
[config:log]
targets = {
    'info'   : [ 'info' ],
    'warn'   : [ 'warn' ],
    'crit'   : [ 'crit' ],
    'error'  : [ 'error' ]
  }
```


### `mattermost`

The `mattermost` service sends messages to a private [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/) instance using _incoming Webhooks_.

Consider the following configuration:

* `hook_url` is the URL of the incoming Webhook
* `channel` is the name of the channel
* `username` (can be None)  specifies the user name as which mqttwarn will post if the Mattermost administrator has allowed override
* `icon_url` is the URL to an icon (can be None, and if not must be resolvable to Mattermost)

```ini
[config:mattermost]
targets = {
                 # hook_url, 	channel, 	username, 	icon_url
    'jpt'	: [ 'http://localhost:8065/hooks/s9x9x8xywjgw9x9x8xyqiujcyo',
    			'town-square',
			'mqttwarn-jpt',
			'http://192.168.1.130/~jpm/ninja.png' ],
    'vehicles'	: [ 'http://127.0.0.1:8065/hooks/a87x8we4wjgwfxmuh7j9x9x8xy',
    			'town-square',
			'owntracks',
			'http://example.org/owntracks.png' ],
  }

[osx/json]
targets = mattermost:jpt
format = I'll have a {fruit} if it costs {price}

[owntracks/+/+]
title = Owntracks position
targets = mattermost:vehicles
```

This will, with appropriate JSON payloads, produce the following posts in Mattermost.

![mattermost](assets/mattermost.png)

Note how this service attempts to format incoming JSON as a Markdown table.


### `mqtt`

The `mqtt` service publishes outbound messages to MQTT topics on **remote
MQTT brokers**, effectively providing powerful [MQTT republishing], topic
rewriting, and bridging/routing capabilities.

:::{seealso}
In order to publish a message _to the same MQTT broker mqttwarn is connected
to_, the [mqttpub](#mqttpub) module is the right choice.
:::

Consider the following configuration snippets:

```ini
[config:mqtt]
hostname =  'localhost'
port =  1883
qos =  0
retain =  False
username =  "jane"
password =  "secret"
targets = {
  'o1'    : [ 'out/food' ],
  'o2'    : [ 'out/fruit/{fruit}' ],
  'm2'	  : [ 'sometopic', 'specialmq.ini' ],
  }

[in/a1]
targets = mqtt:o1, mqtt:o2
format =  'Since when does a {fruit} cost {price}?'
```

The `topicmap` instructs mqttwarn to subscribe to `in/a1`, and republish to two
MQTT targets. The second target (`mqtt:o2`) has a topic branch with a variable
in it which is to be interpolated (`{fruit}`).

These are the results for corresponding publishes:

```
$ mosquitto_pub -t 'in/a1' -m '{"fruit": "pineapple", "price": 131, "tst" : "1391779336"}'

in/a1 {"fruit": "pineapple", "price": 131, "tst" : "1391779336"}
out/food Since when does a pineapple cost 131?
out/fruit/pineapple Since when does a pineapple cost 131?


$ mosquitto_pub -t 'in/a1' -m 'temperature: 12'

in/a1 temperature: 12
out/food temperature: 12
out/fruit/{fruit} temperature: 12
```

In the first case, the JSON payload was decoded and the `fruit` variable could be
interpolated into the topic name of the outgoing publish, whereas the latter shows
the outgoing topic branch without interpolated values, because they simply didn't
exist in the original incoming payload.

The optional second value in the topic map, `specialmq.ini` in the example above,
specifies the name of an INI-type file with parameters which override the basic
configuration of this service. Assume most of your MQTT targets go to `localhost`,
but you want one target to be configured to address a distinct MQTT broker. Create
an INI file with any name you desire and specify that as the optional second
parameter.

```ini
[defaults]
hostname= 10.0.12.1
port= 1884
client_id = blub01
qos = 1
retain = False

[auth]
username = jjolie
password = seecret

[tls]
ca_certs = foobar.crt
;certfile = xxx.crt
;keyfile = xxx.key
tls_version = tlsv1
;ciphers = xxxxx xx
```

This shows the currently full configuration possible. Global values from the
`mqtt` service override those not specified here. Also, if you don't need
authentication using `auth` or `tls`, you may omit those sections. However,
the `defaults` section MUST exist.

:::{note}
Currently, this module creates a new connection to the configured MQTT broker
for each outbound message.
:::


### `mqttpub`

The `mqttpub` service publishes outbound messages to MQTT topics on **the same
MQTT broker** mqttwarn is connected to, effectively providing powerful [MQTT
republishing], topic rewriting, and bridging/routing capabilities.

In order to publish a message to a _different_ MQTT broker, the [mqtt](#mqtt)
module is the right choice.

Each target requires a topic name, the desired `qos`, and a `retain` flag.

```ini
[config:mqttpub]
targets = {
                # topic            qos     retain
    'mout1'   : [ 'mout/1',         0,     False ],
    'special' : [ 'some/{device}',  0,     False ],
  }
```

If the outgoing topic name contains transformation strings, e.g. `out/some/{temp}`,
values are interpolated accordingly. Should this not be possible, e.g. because a
string is not available in the _transformation data_, the message is _not_ published.

:::{note}
This module does not incur the overhead of creating a new connection for each outbound
message.
:::


### `mqtt_filter`

The `mqtt_filter` target executes the specified program and its arguments. It is similar
to `pipe` but it doesn't open a pipe to the program. It provides stdout as response
to a configured queue.
Example use cases are e.g. IoT buttons which publish a message when they are pushed
and they execute an external program. It is also a clone of [mqtt-launcher](https://github.com/jpmens/mqtt-launcher).
With no response configured it acts like `execute` with multiple arguments.

To pass the published data (json args array) to the command, use `{args[0]}` and `{args[1]}` which then gets replaced. Message looks like `'{ "args" : ["' + temp + '","' + room + '"] }'` for `fr
itzctl`.

outgoing_topic is constructed by parts of incoming topic or as full_incoming topic.

```ini
[config:mqtt_filter]
targets = {
   # full_topic, topic[0], topic[1], args[0], .....
   # touch file /tmp/executed
   'touch'    : [ None,0,0,'touch', '/tmp/executed' ],
   # uses firtzctl to set temperature of a room
   'fritzctl' : [ None,0,0,'/usr/bin/fritzctl','--loglevel=ERROR','temperature', "{args[0]}", "{args[1]}" ]
   # performs a dirvish backup and writes stdout as a new messages to response topic
   'backup'   : ["response/{topic[1]}/{topic[2]}",0,0,'/usr/bin/sudo','/usr/sbin/dirvish','--vault', "{args[0]}" ],
   }
```

Use case for fritzctl is to change the requested temperature for a connected thermostat.
Topic is constructed as /home/{room}/temperature/{action}.

```
def TemperatureConvert( data=None, srv=None):

    # optional debug logger
    if srv is not None:
        srv.logging.debug('data={data}, srv={srv}'.format(**locals()))

    topic = str( data.get('topic','') )

    # init
    room = ''
    action = 'status'

    # /home/{room}/temperature/{action}
    parts = topic.split('/')

    for idx, part in enumerate( parts ):
         if idx == 1:
             room = part

         if idx == 3:
             action = part

    temp = str( data.get('payload','sav') )
    if temp == '':
        temp = 'sav'

    if action == 'set':
        cmd = '{ "args" : ["' + temp + '","' + room + '"] }'

    return cmd
```

Use case for backup is to run a dirvish backup triggered by a simple mqtt message.

Note, that for each message targeted to the `mqtt_filter` service, a new process is
spawned (fork/exec), so it is quite "expensive".


### `mysql`

The MySQL plugin will attempt to add a row for every message received on a given
topic, automatically filling in columns.

#### How does it work?
For instance, given a table created with
```sql
CREATE TABLE names (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(25));
```
the message
```json
{ "name" : "Jane Jolie", "id" : 90, "number" : 17 }
```
on topic `my/2` will be added to the table like this:
```text
+------+------------+
| id   | name       |
+------+------------+
|   90 | Jane Jolie |
+------+------------+
```

The values for the `id` and `name` columns are assumed to be filled by the values of
the JSON nodes with the same name.

If you added columns `topic`, `payload` and `_dtiso` to the database, then that same
message will add this row:
```text
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+
| id   | name       | payload                                             | _dtiso                      | topic |
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+
|   90 | Jane Jolie | { "name" : "Jane Jolie", "id" : 90, "number" : 17 } | 2018-09-17T20:20:31.889002Z | my/2  |
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+
```
Here, the plugin pulled values for the new columns from standard mqttwarn metadata.

When a message is received, the plugin will attempt to populate the following column names:
- Root-level JSON fields in the message
  - e.g. `name` and `id` above
- Names for [transformation data fields](#transformations)
  - e.g. `topic`, `payload` and `_dtiso` as above
  - note that these all must be `VARCHAR` columns; timestamp columns are [not yet supported](https://github.com/mqtt-tools/mqttwarn/issues/334#issuecomment-422141808)
- the _fallbackcolumn_, as noted below

To be clear, there is no other way to configure this particular plugin to use different
column names. If you need such a capability, e.g. you want to a column called `receivedAt`
to be filled with the timestamp, then you can use an `alldata` function to transform the
incoming message into a JSON document with the desired node names. Or, you can try the
[mysql_remap](#mysql_remap) plugin.

#### Setup

The MySQL plugin module is one of the most complicated to set up, please read this
documentation section very carefully.

First, it requires the [MySQLDb](https://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/) library to be
installed, which is not trivial. On Debian Linux, it works like this:
```
sudo apt-get install -y python-dev libmysqlclient-dev
sudo pip install MySQL-python
```

It then requires the following configuration section:
```ini
[config:mysql]
host  =  'localhost'
port  =  3306
user  =  'jane'
pass  =  'secret'
dbname  =  'test'
targets = {
            # tablename  #fallbackcolumn ('NOP' to disable)
 'm2'   : [ 'names',     'full'            ]
  }
```

Finally, a topic section:
```ini
[names]
topic = my/#
targets = mysql:m2
```

The target contains a so-called _fallbackcolumn_, into which _mqttwarn_ adds the
remainder of the payload for all columns not targeted with JSON data unless that
is explicitly configured as `NOP` in the service, in which case extra data gets
discarded.

So, let's add the _fallbackcolumn_ to the schema:
```sql
ALTER TABLE names ADD full TEXT;
```

Publishing the same payload again will insert this row into the table:
```text
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| id   | name       | full                                                |
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|   90 | Jane Jolie | NULL                                                |
|   90 | Jane Jolie | { "name" : "Jane Jolie", "id" : 90, "number" : 17 } |
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

As you can imagine, if we add a `number` column to the table, it too will be
correctly populated with the value `17`.

The payload of messages which do not contain valid JSON will be copied verbatim
to the _fallbackcolumn_:

```text
+------+------+-------------+--------+
| id   | name | full        | number |
+------+------+-------------+--------+
| NULL | NULL | I love MQTT |   NULL |
+------+------+-------------+--------+
```

You can add columns with the names of the built-in transformation types
(e.g. `_dthhmmss`) to have those values stored automatically.


### `mysql_dynamic`

This service plugin is similar to the [mysql](#mysql) plugin, but tables and columns
are created dynamically / on demand, as needed. The name of the table is derived from
the MQTT topic, replacing the dash separator with underscores. For example, receiving
data on the MQTT topic `device/laptop/tracks` will create a table named
`device_laptop_tracks`.

The message will be processed, and each JSON field will be stored in a dedicated column.
The columns of each table, and the table itself, are created when the first message is
received on the corresponding topic. The configuration allows you to ignore specific
fields. Those will not be stored in the database.

As an example, by publishing this JSON payload,
```
mosquitto_pub -t my/2 -m '{"name": "Jane Jolie", "id": 90, "number": 17}'
```

... a table named ```my_2``` will be created on the fly, with the following structure
and content. The table name is derived from the MQTT topic, and slashes are replaced by
underscores.
```text
+------+------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| id   | name       | number | payload                                          |
+------+------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
|   90 | Jane Jolie | 17     | '{"name": "Jane Jolie", "id": 90, "number": 17}' |
+------+------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
```

:::{note}
By default, the information is always stored redundantly: Each field separately
within a dedicated column, and all fields together as received within the `payload`
column. If you can use the field ignore capability to disable this behaviour. Actually,
lots of other fields (created by mqttwarn) may be present. Adjust your configuration as
required.
:::

:::{attention} **Limitations:**
At this point, if the payload format or shape changes, the tables are not modified
and data may fail to be stored. Also, there is no fallback table or column like the
[mysql](#mysql) plugin maintains.
:::

#### Configuration
The module requires the following configuration to be present in the configuration file.
```ini
[config:mysql_dynamic]
host  =  'localhost'
port  =  3306
user  =  'dbusername'
pass  =  'dbpassword'
dbname  =  'database'
index   =  'index_table_name'

targets = {
        # target to use: [ list of fields to ignore and not store ]
        'target_name' : ['field1', 'field2','field3' ]
    }
```

#### Index table
An index table, containing a timestamp and the name of the topic, will keep track of
the latest update to the remaining tables. The name of the index table can be specified
in the configuration, and must be created manually. The following statements create an
index table named `index_table_name`.

```
CREATE TABLE `index_table_name` (
  `topic` text NOT NULL,
  `ts` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY `topic` (`topic`(128))
);
```

#### Requirements
* [MySQL-python](https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/)


### `mysql_remap`
This service was originally designed to transform and store [SonOff](https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-pow.html) telemetry messages into a MySQL database, where database doen't need to have columns with same name as values in the MQTT messages.

My new service (called mysql_remap) inserts new record into MySQL.
This is a generic service, however, I designed it to colelct telemetry data from my SonOff POW devices.
This service can add static values (like the source/meaning of the data; e.g. 'bojler_enabled') and can remap keys (e.g. current power consumption data comes as 'current' but stored in DB as 'value').

Example configuration:

In the below configuration 'test' is the name of the table, 'Time' is a key comes from the MQTT message what will be renamed to 'timestamp' when service insert the data intothe table. If a message key isn't named here it won't be inserted into the database even it is in the message.

'description' is a column name in the database table and 'heater_power' is a constant to make filtering possible later on by SQL querys. You can add zero or more from these.

```ini
[defaults]
hostname  = 'localhost'
port      = 1883
loglevel  = DEBUG

launch   = mysql_remap

#functions = 'funcs.py'

[config:mysql_remap]
host  =  'localhost'
port  =  3306
user  =  'root'
pass  =  '123'
dbname  =  'test'
targets = {
         't1'   : [ 'test',
                            {
                              'Time': 'timestamp',
                              'Power': 'value'
                            },
                            {
                              'description' : 'heater_power'
                            }
                  ]
         }

[tele/+/SENSOR]
targets = mysql_remap:t1
#alldata = powerBinFunc()
```

You can also do some further transformation on the message before insert it into the database using by the two uncommented lines above and the below function (need to copy it into funcs.py).

This below example convert reveived data and time information itno unix timestam format and replace "ON" and "OFF" values to 1 and 0 numbers.

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import time
import copy
import ast
from datetime import datetime

def powerBinFunc(topic, data, srv=None):
    # parse json payload (the message)
    payload = ast.literal_eval(data["payload"])

    # Override default time format
    dt = datetime.strptime(payload["Time"], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
    ts = time.mktime(dt.timetuple())
    ret = dict( payload = dict( Time = ts ))

    # Check power state key
    if "POWER" in payload:
        if payload["POWER"] == "ON":
            ret["POWER_BIN"] = 1
        else:
            ret["POWER_BIN"] = 0

    return ret

# vim: tabstop=4 expandtab
```


Example MQTT message:

```
17:08:45 MQT: tele/bojler/SENSOR = {"Time":"2018-04-15T17:08:45","ENERGY":{"Total":320.144,"Yesterday":5.105,"Today":1.881,"Period":0,"Power":17.15,"Factor":0.07,"Voltage":234,"Current":0.128}}
```

Example MySQL records:

```
+------------+-----------+----------------+
| timestamp  | value     | description    |
+------------+-----------+----------------+
| 1523804925 |  17.15000 | heater_power   |
+------------+-----------+----------------+
```

### `mythtv`

This service allows for on-screen notification pop-ups on [MythTV] instances.
Each target address descriptor requires the address and port of the MythTV
backend instance (`<hostname>:<port>`), and a broadcast address.

```ini
[config:mythtv]
timeout = 10  # duration of notification
targets = {
                          # host:port             broadcast address
    'all'               :  [ '192.168.1.40:6544', '192.168.1.255'],
    'frontend_bedroom'  :  [ '192.168.1.40:6544', '192.168.1.74' ]
    }
```

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                              |
| ------------- | :----: |------------------------------------------|
| `title`       |   O    | notification title (default: `mqttwarn`) |
| `image`       |   O    | notification image URL                   |

[MythTV]: https://www.mythtv.org/


### `nntp`

The `nntp` service is used to post articles to an NNTP news server on a particular newsgroup.

```ini
[config:nntp]
server  = t1.prox
port    = 119
; username = "jane@example.com"
; password = "secret"
targets = {
    #            from_hdr                        newsgroup
    'aa'     : [ 'Me and I <jj@example.com>',    'jp.aa' ],
  }
```

Each target's configuration includes the value given to the `From:` header as well as
a single newsgroup to which the article is posted.

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                              |
| ------------- | :----: |------------------------------------------|
| `title`       |   O    | The post's subject (default: `mqttwarn`) |

#### Example

Publishing a message to MQTT...
```shell
mosquitto_pub -t nn/ohoh -m '{"name": "Jane Jolie", "number": 47, "id": 91}'
```

...turns into:
```text
Path: t1.prox!t1.prox!not-for-mail
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

```


### `nsca`

The `nsca` service is used to submit passive Nagios/Icinga checks to an [NSCA] daemon.
NSCA is a Linux/Unix daemon allows you to integrate passive alerts and checks from
remote machines and applications with Nagios.

#### Example
Consider the following Icinga service description which configures a passive service.
```
define service {
        use                    generic-service
        host_name              localhost
        service_description    Current temp via MQTT
        active_checks_enabled  0
        passive_checks_enabled 1
        check_freshness        0
        check_command          check_dummy!1
        }
```

with the following target definition in `mqttwarn.ini`.
```ini
[config:nsca]
nsca_host = '172.16.153.112'
targets = {
   #              Nagios hostname       Nagios service description
   'temp'    :  [ 'localhost',          'Current temp via MQTT' ],
  }

[arduino/temp]
targets = nsca:temp
; OK = 0, WARNING = 1, CRITICAL = 2, UNKNOWN = 3
priority = check_temperature()
format = Current temperature: {temp}C
```

The transformation function assigned by `priority = check_temperature()` computes
the status to be submitted to Nagios/Icinga. It has been defined like this within
`udf.py`.
```python
from pynsca import OK, WARNING, CRITICAL, UNKNOWN

def check_temperature(data):
    """
    Compute Nagios/Icinga warning status, depending on the temperature value.
    """
    OK = 0
    WARNING = 1
    CRITICAL = 2
    UNKNOWN = 3
    if type(data) == dict:
        if 'temp' in data:
            temp = int(data['temp'])
            if temp < 20:
                return OK
            if temp < 25:
                return WARNING
            return CRITICAL

    return UNKNOWN
```

Now, when publishing a message to MQTT,
```shell
mosquitto_pub -t arduino/temp -m '{"temp": 20}'
```
... a corresponding monitoring event has been produced.

### `ntfy`

> [ntfy] (pronounce: _notify_) is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub] notification service.
> It allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from
> any computer, entirely without signup, cost or setup.
> [ntfy is also open source](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy), if you want to
> run an instance on your own premises.

ntfy uses topics to address communication channels. This topic is part of the
HTTP API URL.

To use the hosted variant on `ntfy.sh`, just provide an URL including the topic.
```ini
[config:ntfy]
targets  = {
    'test': 'https://ntfy.sh/testdrive',
    }
```

When running your own instance, you would use a custom URL here.
```ini
[config:ntfy]
targets  = {
    'test': 'http://username:password@localhost:5555/testdrive',
    }
```

In order to specify more options, please wrap your ntfy URL into a dictionary
under the `url` key. This way, additional options can be added.
```ini
[config:ntfy]
targets  = {
    'test': {
        'url': 'https://ntfy.sh/testdrive',
        },
    }
```

:::{note}
[ntfy publishing options] outlines different ways to marshal data to the ntfy
HTTP API. mqttwarn utilizes two variants to submit the notification to ntfy,
using both the HTTP PUT and POST methods, and encoding ntfy option fields into
HTTP headers with [RFC 2047] MIME [quoted-printable encoding].

- Per default, send the message as HTTP body, enabling line breaks.
- When submitting a local attachment without a text message, encode the
  attachment data into the HTTP body, and all other fields into HTTP headers.
- When it is a notification with both a local attachment, and a text message,
  also encode the attachment data into the HTTP body, but replace all newline
  characters `\n` of the text message, because they can not be encoded into
  HTTP headers.

Effectively, this means you can not submit notification message texts including
newline characters and local attachments at the same time. When adding a local
attachment, all newline characters will implicitly be replaced by space characters.
:::

{#ntfy-remote-attachments}
#### Remote attachments
In order to submit notifications with an attachment file at a remote location,
use the `attach` field. Optionally, the `filename` field can be used to assign
a different name to the file.
```ini
[config:ntfy]
targets  = {
    'test': {
        'url': 'https://ntfy.sh/testdrive',
        'attach': 'https://unsplash.com/photos/spdQ1dVuIHw/download?w=320',
        'filename': 'goat.jpg',
        },
    }
```

{#ntfy-local-attachments}
#### Local attachments
By using the `attachment` option, you can add an attachment to your message, local
to the machine mqttwarn is running on. The file will be uploaded when submitting
the notification, and ntfy will serve it for clients so that you don't have to. In
order to address the file, you can provide a path template, where the transformation
data will also get interpolated into.
```ini
[config:ntfy]
targets  = {
    'test': {
        'url': 'https://ntfy.sh/testdrive',
        'file': '/tmp/ntfy-attachment-{slot}-{label}.png',
        }
    }
```
:::{important}
In order to allow users to **upload** and attach files to notifications, you will
need to enable the corresponding ntfy feature by simply configuring an attachment
cache directory and a base URL (`attachment-cache-dir`, `base-url`), see
[ntfy stored attachments].
:::
:::{note}
When mqttwarn processes a message, and accessing the file raises an error, it gets
handled gracefully. In this way, notifications will be triggered even when attaching
the file fails for whatever reasons.
:::

#### Publishing options
You can use all the available [ntfy publishing options], by using the corresponding
option names listed within `NTFY_FIELD_NAMES`, which are: `message`, `title`, `tags`, 
`priority`, `actions`, `click`, `attach`, `filename`, `delay`, `icon`, `email`,
`cache`, `firebase`, and `unifiedpush`. See also the [list of all ntfy option fields].

You can obtain ntfy option fields from _three_ contexts in total, as implemented
by the `obtain_ntfy_fields` function. Effectively, that means that you can place
them either within the `targets` address descriptor, within the configuration
section, or submit them using a JSON MQTT message and a corresponding decoder
function into the transformation data dictionary.

For example, you can always send a `priority` field using MQTT/JSON, or use one of
those configuration snippets, which are equivalent.
```ini
[config:ntfy]
targets  = {
    'test': {
        'url': 'https://ntfy.sh/testdrive',
        'priority': 'high',
        }
    }
```
```ini
[config:ntfy]
targets  = {
    'test': {
        'url': 'https://ntfy.sh/testdrive',
        }
    }
priority = high
```

The highest precedence takes data coming in from the transformation data dictionary,
followed by option fields coming in from the per-recipient `targets` address descriptor,
followed by option fields defined on the `[config:ntfy]` configuration section.

#### Examples

1. This is another way to write the "[remote attachments](#ntfy-remote-attachments)"
   example, where all ntfy options are located on the configuration section, so they
   will apply for all configured target addresses.
   ```ini
   [config:ntfy]
   targets  = {'test': 'https://ntfy.sh/testdrive'}
   attach   = https://unsplash.com/photos/spdQ1dVuIHw/download?w=320
   filename = goat.jpg
   ```

2. The tutorial [](#processing-frigate-events) explains how to configure mqttwarn to
   notify the user with events emitted by Frigate, a network video recorder (NVR)
   with realtime local object detection for IP cameras.

### `osxsay`

The `osxsay` service alerts you on your macOS system with a spoken voice, using
the [say] utility. You can configure any number of different targets, each with
a different voice. See `say -v ?` for a list of allowed voice names.

```ini
[config:osxsay]
targets = {
                 # voice (see `man say or `say -v ?`)
    'victoria' : [ 'Victoria' ],
    'alex'     : [ 'Alex' ],
  }

[say/warn]
targets = osxsay:victoria

[say/alert]
targets = osxsay:alex
```
:::{note}
Your speakers need to be enabled, and it can be a pain for your co-workers or family
members. Also, we can't show you a screenshot.

### `pastebinpub`

The `pastebinpub` service is publishing messages to [Pastebin], using the
[Pastebin API] package.

```ini
[config:pastebinpub]
targets = {
    'warn': [ 'api_dev_key',  # API dev key
              'username',     # Username
              'password',     # Password
              1,             # Privacy level
              '1H'            # Expiration
            ]
    }
```

![pastebin](assets/pastebin.png)

:::{note}
If you are not a paying customer of Pastebin, you are limited to 25 unlisted
and 10 private pastes.
:::

:::{attention}
Be careful what you post on this target, it could be public.

### `pipe`

The `pipe` target launches the specified program and its arguments and pipes the
outbound message from mqttwarn into the program's _stdin_ channel. If the message
does not have a trailing newline (`\n`), _mqttwarn_ appends one.

```ini
[config:pipe]
targets = {
         # argv0 ...
   'wc': [ 'wc', '-l' ]
   }
```

:::{warning}
For each message processed by the `pipe` service, a new process is spawned (fork/exec),
so this service plugin is more expensive than other pure-Python ones.
:::


### `postgres`

The `postgres` plugin behaves virtually identically to the [MySQL](#mysql) plugin above. It is configured in the same way:

```ini
[config:postgres]
host  =  'localhost'
port  =  5432
user  =  'jane'
pass  =  'secret'
dbname  =  'test'
targets = {
          # tablename  # fallbackcolumn  # schema
 'pg'   : [ 'names',   'message',	 'schema' ]
  }
```

Suppose we create the following table for the target specified above:

```
CREATE TABLE names (id INTEGER, name CHARACTER VARYING(128));
```

and publish this JSON payload:

```
mosquitto_pub -t pg/1 -m '{ "name" : "Jane Jolie", "id" : 90, "number" : 17 }'
```

This will result in the two columns `id` and `name` being populated:

```postgres
+------+------------+
| id   | name       |
+------+------------+
|   90 | Jane Jolie |
+------+------------+
```

Exactly as in the `MySQL` plugin, a _fallback column_ can be defined into which _mqttwarn_ adds
the "rest of" the payload for all columns not targeted with JSON data. Lets now
add our fallback column to the schema:

```postgres
ALTER TABLE names ADD message TEXT;
```

Publishing the same payload again, will insert this row into the table:

```postgres
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| id   | name       | message                                             |
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|   90 | Jane Jolie | NULL                                                |
|   90 | Jane Jolie | { "name" : "Jane Jolie", "id" : 90, "number" : 17 } |
+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

As you can imagine, if we add a `number` column to the table, it too will be
correctly populated with the value `17`.

The payload of messages which do not contain valid JSON will be coped verbatim
to the _fallback_ column:

```postgres
+------+------+-------------+--------+
| id   | name | message     | number |
+------+------+-------------+--------+
| NULL | NULL | I love MQTT |   NULL |
+------+------+-------------+--------+
```

You can add columns with the names of the built-in transformation types (e.g. `_dthhmmss`, see below)
to have those values stored automatically.


### `prowl`

This service is for [Prowl], based on [pyprowl]. Each target requires an application
key and an application name.

```ini
[config:prowl]
targets = {
                 # application key                           # app name
    'pjpm'    :  [ 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', 'SuperAPP' ]
    }
```

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                             |
| ------------- | :----: |-----------------------------------------|
| `title`       |   O    | application title (default: `mqttwarn`) |
| `priority`    |   O    | priority. (default: 0)                     |

### `pushbullet`

This service is for [Pushbullet], an app for Android along with an extension for
Chrome and Firefox, which allows notes, links, pictures, addresses and files to be
sent between devices.

You can get your API key from the [Pushbullet account page] after signing up, see
also [Pushbullet » Getting an access token].

You will also need the device ID to push the notifications to. To obtain this,
you can, for example, follow the instructions at [pyPushBullet], by running
```shell
./pushbullet_cmd.py YOUR_API_KEY_HERE getdevices
```

The configuration layout looks like this.
```ini
[config:pushbullet]
targets = {
    "warnme"   : {
        "access_token": "a6FJVAA0LVJKrT8k",
        "recipient": "test@example.org",
        "recipient_type": "email",
        },
    "alertme"   : {
        "access_token": "a6FJVAA0LVJKrT8k",
        "recipient": "ujpah72o0sjAoRtnM0jc",
        },
    }
```

The optional _recipient_type_ could be one of `device` (default), `email`, `channel`
or `client`. See also [Pushbullet target parameters].

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                             |
| ------------- | :----: |-----------------------------------------|
| `title`       |   O    | application title (default: `mqttwarn`) |

need to submit files or links, please let us know on the [mqttwarn issue tracker].
:::


### `pushover`

This service is for [Pushover], an app for iOS and Android.

In order to receive pushover notifications, you need what is called a _user key_
and one or more _application keys_, which you configure within the target address
descriptor definition.

```ini
[config:pushover]
callback = None
targets = {
    'nagios'     : ['userkey1', 'appkey1', 'sound1'],
    'alerts'     : ['userkey2', 'appkey2'],
    'tracking'   : ['userkey1', 'appkey2', None, 'cellphone1,cellphone2'],
    'extraphone' : ['userkey2', 'appkey3']
    }
```

This defines four targets (`nagios`, `alerts`, etc.), which are directed to the
configured _user key_ and _app key_ combinations. This in turn enables you to
notify, say, one or more of your devices as well as one for your spouse. As you
can see in the example, you can even specify an optional sound to be played for
the individual users. For a list of available sounds see the [list of Pushover
sounds].

You can also specify the devices that should be notified, this is a comma-separated
list of device names specified as a single string. If you want to specify custom
devices, but don't want to specify a custom sound, you have to pass `None` for the
sound.

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                                   |
| ------------- | :----: |-----------------------------------------------|
| `title`       |   O    | application title (default: pushover default) |
| `priority`    |   O    | priority. (default: pushover setting)         |

Users can enable the [Pushover HTML/Message Styling] or [Pushover Supplementary URLs]
support options in messages, by adding the `html`, `url`, and `url_title` keys to the
data object. `callback` is an optional URL to [acknowledge Pushover messages].

```ini
[config:pushover]
callback = None
alldata = PushoverAllData()
```

```python
def PushoverAllData(topic, data, srv=None):
	return {
		'url': 'https://somedomain/path',
	}
```

The pushover service will accept a payload with either a simple text message, or a
JSON payload which contains a `message` and either an `imageurl` or `imagebase64`
encoded image.

The default values for PushOver's API `expire` and `retry` settings can be adjusted
either by setting the `api_expire` / `api_retry` keys in the config section, or via
the `PUSHOVER_API_RETRY` / `PUSHOVER_API_EXPIRE` environmental variables.

The configuration settings will take precedence over environmental variables.
The default values are 60 and 3600 respectively. These settings can further be adjusted
on a per-message basis by setting the `expire` and `retry` keys in the data object.
```ini
[config:pushover]
callback = None
api_expire = 30
api_retry = 1800
alldata = PushoverAllData()
```

```python
def PushoverAllData(topic, data, srv=None):
	return {
		'expire': 120,
		'retry': 3600,
	}
```

Further, the imageurl payload can have the additional parameters of an auth type
(basic, digest) and a user and password. This is useful if your imaging device uses
authentication. For example, some IP cameras, or some other simple internet based image
services.

The following payloads are valid examples.

```
Simple text message
```

```json
{
    "message": "Message only, with no image"
}
```

```json
{
    "message": "Message with base64 encoded image",
    "imagebase64": "<base64 encoded image>"
}
```

```json
{
    "message": "Message with image downloaded from URL",
    "imageurl": "<image url>"
}
```

```json
{
    "message": "Message with image downloaded from URL: digest authentication",
    "imageurl": "<image url>",
    "auth": "digest",
    "user": "myspecialuser",
    "password": "myspecialpassword"
}
```
For the above example, we recommend this to be used in a local MQTT environment
only, because the password for your imaging device is being transmitted in clear-text
to mqttwarn.

{#pushsafer}
### `pushsafer`

[Pushsafer](https://www.pushsafer.com) is an app for iOS, Android and Windows 10.
You can define different notification targets, in turn dispatching to one or 
multiple Pushsafer devices or groups.
For a list of available icons, sounds and other parameters, see the
[Pushsafer API](https://www.pushsafer.com/en/pushapi) documentation.

#### Requirements
In order to receive Pushsafer notifications, you need what is called a _private 
or alias key_. To receive such a key, you will need to sign up for an account.

#### Configuration example

```ini
[config:pushsafer]
; https://www.pushsafer.com/en/pushapi
; https://www.pushsafer.com/en/pushapi_ext
targets = {
    'basic': { 'private_key': '3SAz1a2iTYsh19eXIMiO' },
    'nagios': {
        'private_key': '3SAz1a2iTYsh19eXIMiO',
        'device': '52|65|78',
        'icon': 64,
        'sound': 2,
        'vibration': 1,
        'url': 'http://example.org',
        'url_title': 'Example Org',
        'time_to_live': 60,
        'priority': 2,
        'retry': 60,
        'expire': 600,
        'answer': 1,
        'answeroptions': 'yes|no|maybe',
        'answerforce': 1,
        'confirm': 10,
        },
    'tracking': {
        'private_key': '3SAz1a2iTYsh19eXIMiO',
        'device': 'gs23',
        'icon': 18,
        },
    'extraphone': { 'private_key': 'aliaskey2', 'time_to_live': 60, 'priority': 2, 'retry': 60, 'expire': 600, 'answer': 0 },
    'warnme': { 'private_key': 'aliaskey3', 'time_to_live': 60, 'priority': 1, 'answer': 1, 'answerforce': 1, 'confirm': 10 },
    }
```

#### MQTT topic options

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                            |
| ------------- | :----: | -------------------------------------- |
| `title`       |   O    | application title (dflt: pushsafer dflt) |

:::{note}
- For configuring delivery retries, you must set both parameters, 
  [Retry](https://www.pushsafer.com/en/pushapi_ext#API-RE), **and**
  [Expire](https://www.pushsafer.com/en/pushapi_ext#API-EX).
- The legacy configuration layout, based on a list for the `addrs` slot,
  is still supported.

### `redispub`

The `redispub` plugin publishes to a [Redis] channel, using the [redis-py]
package.

```ini
[config:redispub]
host  =  'localhost'
port  =  6379
targets = {
    'r1'      : [ 'channel-1' ]
    }
```

[Redis]: https://github.com/redis/redis
[redis-py]: https://pypi.org/project/redis/


### `rrdtool`

The `rrdtool` plugin updates a round-robin database created by [rrdtool] with
the message payload, using the [Python rrdtool bindings].

```ini
[config:rrdtool]
targets = {
    'living-temp'  : ['/tmp/living-temp.rrd',  '--template', 'temp'],
    'kitchen-temp' : ['/tmp/kitchen-temp.rrd', '--template', 'temp']
    }
```

[rrdpython's API] expects strings and/or a list of strings as parameters to the functions.
Thus, a list for a target simply contains the command line arguments for `rrdtool update`.

The plugin will embed the message as final argument `N:<message>`, if the message is an
integer number. Otherwise, it will break up the message into single words and append this 
list to the list supplied by the target. This leaves it to your discretion _where_ to put
arguments and even - with the right data mapping and extraction in place - allows for 
a configuration like:

```ini
[config:rrdtool]
targets = {
        'battsensor': [ ],
        }
...
[datalog-battery-log]
topic = datalog/sensors/batt/+
targets = log:info,rrdtool:battsensor
datamap = ...
format = /srv/rrd/sensors/{sensor_id}.rrd -t batt {ts}:{batt}
```

[rrdtool]: https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/
[rrdpython's API]: https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/prog/rrdpython.en.html
[Python rrdtool bindings]: https://pypi.org/project/rrdtool/


### `serial`

The `serial` plugin sends out received messages to the serial port. Message payload can be binary data, string or json.

```ini
[config:serial]
append_newline = False
targets = {
    'serialport1'  : ['/dev/ttyUSB0',  '115200'],
    'some-device' : ['socket://192.168.1.100:2323', '9600']
    }
```
First parameter in target config can be a portname or an [url handler](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/url_handlers.html).
Second parameter is the baudrate for the port.
If `append_newline` is True, a newline character is unconditionally appended to the string written to the serialport.

Requires the pyserial bindings available with `pip install pyserial`.


### `slack`

The `slack` plugin posts messages to channels in or users of the [slack.com]
service, using the [Python Slack SDK]. The configuration of this service
requires an API token.

```ini
[config:slack]
token = 'xxxx-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890-1234a1'
targets = {
                #   [token,] #channel/@user, username, icon, [as_user]
   'jpmens'     : [ '@jpmens',   "Alerter",   ':door:'          ],
   'general'    : [ '#general',  "mqttwarn",  ':syringe:'       ],
   'test'       : [ '#test',     "BotUser",   ':unused:',  True ],
   'second-acc' : [ 'xxxx-9999999-9999999-99999999', '#general', "test", ':house:' ],
  }
```

The service level `token` is optional, but if missing, each target must have a
`token` defined.

Each target defines the name of an existing channel (`#channelname`), or a user
(`@username`), to be addressed, the name of the sending user, as well as an
optional [emoji icon] to use.

Also, optionally, a target can define the message to get posted as a user, per
[Slack message authorship]. Note that posting as a user in a channel is only
possible, if the user has already joined the channel.

![Slack](assets/slack.png)


The slack service will accept a payload with either a simple text message, or a
JSON payload, which contains a `message` and either an `imageurl` or `imagebase64`
encoded image.

Further, the `imageurl` payload can have the additional parameters of an auth type
(basic, digest), and a user and password. This is useful if your imaging device
uses authentication, for example some IP cameras, or some other simple internet
based image services.

The following messages are valid payloads.

```
Simple text message
```

```json
{
    "message": "Message only, with no image"
}
```

```json
 {
    "message": "Message with base64 encoded image",
    "imagebase64": "<base64 encoded image>"
 }
```

```json
 {
    "message": "Message with image downloaded from URL",
    "imageurl": "<image url>"
 }
```

```json
 {
    "message": "Message with image downloaded from URL: digest authentication",
    "imageurl": "<image url>",
    "auth": "digest",
    "user": "myspecialuser",
    "password": "myspecialpassword"
 }
```
For the above example, we only recommend this be used on a local MQTT server instance,
because the password for your imaging device is being transmitted in clear-text to mqttwarn.

### `smtp`

The `smtp` service effectively implements an MQTT to SMTP gateway.

```ini
[config:smtp]
server  =  'localhost:25'
sender  =  "MQTTwarn <jpm@localhost>"
username  =  None
password  =  None
starttls  =  False
# Optional send msg as html or only plain text
htmlmsg   =  False
targets = {
    'localj'     : [ 'jpm@localhost' ],
    'special'    : [ 'ben@gmail', 'suzie@example.net' ]
    }
```

Targets may contain more than one recipient, in which case all specified
recipients will get the message.

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                                        |
| ------------- | :----: |----------------------------------------------------|
| `title`       |   O    | e-mail subject. (default: `mqttwarn notification`) |


### `sqlite`

The `sqlite` plugin creates a table in the database file specified in the target address
descriptor, and creates a schema with a **single column** called `payload` of type `TEXT`.
_mqttwarn_ will write and commit messages into this table correspondingly.

```ini
[config:sqlite]
targets = {
                   #path        #tablename
  'demotable' : [ '/tmp/m.db',  'mqttwarn'  ]
  }
```


### `sqlite_json2cols`

The `sqlite_json2cols` plugin creates a table in the database file specified in the target
address descriptor, and creates a schema based on the JSON payload. It will create a **column
for each JSON field** and rudimentary try to determine its datatype on creation (`float` or
`char`). If the table already exists, no table will be created.

```ini
[config:sqlite_json2cols]
targets = {
                   #path        #tablename
  'demotable' : [ '/tmp/m.db',  'mqttwarn'  ]
  }
```

As an example, let's publish a JSON payload.
```
mosquitto_pub -t test/hello -m '{ "name": "Thor", "Father": "Odin", "Age": 30 }'
```

When _mqttwarn_ receives that message, it will create a database table with the following
structure and content.
```
+------+--------+------+
| name | Father | Age  |
+------+--------+------+
| Thor | Odin   | 30.0 |
+------+--------+------+
```


### `sqlite_timestamp`

The `sqlite_timestamp` plugin works just like the [](#sqlite) plugin, but it creates three
columns: `id`, `payload` and `timestamp`. The `id` is the table index, and the `timestamp`
is the record insertion date and time in seconds.
```ini
[config:sqlite_timestamp]
targets = {
                   #path        #tablename
  'demotable' : [ '/tmp/m.db',  'mqttwarn'  ]
  }
```


### `ssh`

The `ssh` service can run commands over SSH. Target address descriptors may contain
**exactly one command**.

```ini
[config:ssh]
host  = '192.168.1.1'
port  = 22
user  = 'username'
pass  = 'password'
targets = {
		's01'    : [ 'command with one substitution %s' ],
		's02'    : [ 'command with two substitutions %s__%s' ]
    }

[ssh/+]
format = {args}
targets = ssh:s01

[dualssh/+]
format = {args}
targets = ssh:s02
```

```shell
mosquitto_pub -t dualssh/test -m '{ "args": ["test", "test2"] }'
```

#### Authentication

If both username and password are defined in the mqttwarn configuration, they will be used
to connect to the host. If both user and password are *not* defined in the configuration,
the service will parse the user's SSH config file to see which key (`IdentityFile`) to use.
It will also use `User` and `Port` options from this file.

When using a key, only the host name is required. The output is ignored for now.

:::{attention}
Using this module lets you specify a username and a password which can be used to log in to
the target system. As such, your `mqttwarn.ini` configuration file should be well protected
from prying eyes! Of course, this applies in general, for other target specifications with
credentials as well.

### `syslog`

The `syslog` service transfers MQTT messages to a local syslog server. Example output:
```
Apr 22 12:42:42 mqttest019 mqttwarn[9484]: Disk utilization: 94%
```

```ini
[config:syslog]
targets = {
              # facility    priority,  option
    'user'   : ['user',     'debug',  'pid'],
    'kernel' : ['kernel',   'warn',   'pid']
    }
```

| Topic option  |  M/O   | Description                             |
| ------------- | :----: |-----------------------------------------|
| `title`       |   O    | application title (default: `mqttwarn`) |
| `priority`    |   O    | log level (default: -1)                 |

The value of the `priority` field can be between -2 and 5, and maps to corresponding
`syslog` levels, according to this table.

| Priority | Syslog Log Level |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| -2       | LOG_DEBUG        |
| -1       | LOG_INFO         |
| 0        | LOG_NOTICE       |
| 1        | LOG_WARNING      |
| 2        | LOG_ERR          |
| 3        | LOG_CRIT         |
| 4        | LOG_ALERT        |
| 5        | LOG_EMERG        |


### `telegram`

This service plugin submits messages as a Bot to a [Telegram] chat. In order to configure it
properly, you will need to set up a Bot and obtain its authentication token which you add to
_mqttwarn_'s configuration. You will also need to start a chat with this Bot, so it is able to
communicate with a particular user.

Optionally, you can specify `parse_mode`, which will be used during message sending. Please
check the [Telegram formatting options] for additional information.

```ini
[config:telegram]
timeout = 60
parse_mode = 'Markdown'
token = 'mmmmmmmmm:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'
targets = {
   #        First Name or @username or #chat_id
   'j01' : [ 'First Name' ],
   'j02' : [ '@username' ],
   'j03' : [ '#chat_id' ]
    }
```

![Telegram](assets/telegram.png)

:::{attention}
There is a possible issue: When `First name`, or `@username` was specified as recipient, the
plugin will call the [Telegram "getUpdates" API], in order to retrieve the `chat_id`, but this
call returns just the most recent 100 messages. So, if you haven't spoken to your Bot recently,
it may well be possible _mqttwarn_ can't find the `chat_id` associated with you. If the
`chat_id` is known, it can be set as a recipient using the `#` prefix.
:::

#### Using `chat_id`

If you know the `chat_id`, you can specify the `telegram` service to use that `chat_id` directly.
If you configure the service plugin this way, please note that this mode will be used for all
the configured recipients.

The quickest way to get the `chat_id`, is by visiting this URL (insert your api key), and getting
the id from the "from" section: https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_API_TOKEN/getUpdates 

```ini
[config:telegram]
timeout = 60
parse_mode = 'Markdown'
token = 'mmmmmmmmm:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'
use_chat_id = True
targets = {
    #       chat_id (in quotes)
    'j01' : ['123456789']
    }
```

### `thingspeak`

The `thingspeak` service publishes data to the [ThingSpeak] platform, using its HTTP API,
see [ThingSpeak "Write Data" API].

```ini
[config:thingspeak]
targets = {
                   #API WRITE KEY       field      optional builddata=true/false
    'field1'   : [ 'XXYYZZXXYYZZXXYY', 'field1' , 'true' ],
    'field2'   : [ 'XXYYZZXXYYZZXXYY', 'field2' ],
    'composite': [ 'XXYYZZXXYYZZXXYY', [ 'temp', 'hum' ] ]
  }
```
Using `builddata=true`, you can build an update with multiple fields in one update. When
using this function, no direct update is performed. Only with the next update, without
`builddata=true`, all entries are sent. For example, when multiple sensors are updating
different topics, you can buffer/record the data, and submit it when data has been received
from the last sensor subscription.

Supply an ordered list of message data field names to extract several values from a single
message, for example `{ "temp": 10, "hum": 77 }`. Values will be assigned to the venerable
ThingSpeak `field1`, `field2`, ... telemetry fields, in order of decoding.

:::{note}
Make sure to define the field name like in the example shown above, using `'field1'`:
It should be defined as string, lower case, with the last digit being the field number.

### `tootpaste`

The `tootpaste` service is for posting to the [Mastodon social network], based on the
[Mastodon.py] Python wrapper.

```shell
pip install 'mqttwarn[tootpaste]'
```

```ini
[config:tootpaste]
targets = {
             # client credentials,       user credentials,      base_url
    'uno'  : [ '/path/to/client.creds',  '/path/to/user.creds', 'https://masto.io' ],
  }
```
:::{note}
The specified _client credentials_ and _user credentials_ options are paths to files
created with the command presented in the next section.
:::

:::{warning}
The credentials files should be protected from prying eyes.

#### Configure authentication

In order to configure the plugin properly, you will need to obtain both client/application
credentials, and a user authorization token. [Mastodon » Logging in with an account] is the
canonical documentation, and [How to get credentials for the Mastodon API with Mastodon.py]
also outlines corresponding step-by-step instructions.

_mqttwarn_'s `tootpaste` service plugin ships with an implementation for that authorization
process, which boils down the instructions to invoking a single command.
```
#   baseurl            email              password      client   client credentials    user credentials      
python -m mqttwarn.services.tootpaste \
    'https://masto.io' 'jane@example.org' 'xafa5280890' mqttwarn /path/to/client.creds /path/to/user.creds
```

The arguments are, in order:

1. base URL (e.g. `https://mastodon.social`)
2. your e-mail address
3. the password corresponding to the e-mail address
4. the client name (name of the posting program)
5. path to the file storing the client credentials
6. path to the file storing the user credentials

### `twilio`

The `twilio` service submits messages to the [Twilio] API, using the [twilio-python] package.

```ini
[config:twilio]
targets = {
             # Account SID            Auth Token            from              to
   'hola'  : [ 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY', "+15105551234",  "+12125551234" ]
   }
```

### `twitter`

The `twitter` service plugin submits notification events to the [Twitter] platform,
using the [python-twitter] API wrapper package.

It will need you to set up a [Twitter Developer App], in order to generate and obtain
four credential values: 

- API Key and Secret (also known as Consumer Key and Secret)
- Access Token and Secret

Upon configuring this service's targets, make sure the four (4) elements of the
list are in the order specified!
```ini
[config:twitter]
targets = {
  'janejol'   :  [ 'vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv',                              # api_key
                   'wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww',          # api_secret
                   'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',  # access_token_key
                   'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz'           # access_token_secret
                  ]
   }
```

![a tweet](assets/twitter.jpg)


:::{note}
Please make sure the four credential values are specified in the correct order.

:::{todo}
This is a perfect candidate to use [named target address descriptor options] instead.

### `websocket`

The websocket service can be used to send data to a websocket endpoint defined by its URI,
using the [websocket-client] Python package. Both `ws://` or `wss://` URI schemas are supported.

```ini
[config:websocket]
targets = {
        # targetid      wsuri
        'wssserver' : [ 'ws://localhost/ws' ],
} 
```

[websocket-client]: https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/


### `xbmc`

The `xbmc` service plugin invokes on-screen notification pop-ups on [Kodi] (formerly [XBMC])
instances. For each target, you will need to configure the address and port of the Kodi instance
(`<hostname>:<port>`), and an optional username and password, when authentication is required.

```ini
[config:xbmc]
targets = {
                          # host:port,           user    password
    'bedroom_no_auth'  :  [ '192.168.1.41:8080' ],
    'living_with_auth' :  [ '192.168.1.40:8080', 'xbmc', 'xbmc' ]
    }
```

### `xmpp`

The `xmpp` service sends notifications to one or more [XMPP] (Jabber) recipients,
using the [xmpppy] Python package.

```ini
[config:xmpp]
sender = 'mqttwarn@jabber.server'
password = '<password>'
targets = {
    'admin' : [ 'admin1@jabber.server' ],
    'sig'   : [ 'user1@jabber.server', 'user2@jabber.server' ]
    }
```

[XMPP]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP
[xmpppy]: https://github.com/xmpppy/xmpppy


### `slixmpp`

The `slixmpp` service sends notification to one or more [XMPP] (Jabber) recipients.

```ini
[config:slixmpp]
sender = 'mqttwarn@jabber.server'
password = 'Password for sender'
targets = {
    'admin' : [ 'admin1@jabber.server', 'admin2@jabber.server' ]
    }
```

Targets may contain more than one recipient, in which case all specified
recipients get the message.

Requires:
* XMPP (Jabber) accounts (at least one for the sender and one for the recipient)
* [slixmpp](https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/slixmpp)


### `zabbix`

As an introduction, the blog post [Zabbix meets MQTT] explains a bit of the background,
and which thought process went into integrating [Zabbix] with MQTT and mqttwarn. Following
this rationale, the `zabbix` service plugin implements two things.

1. Create a Zabbix host on the fly, via [Zabbix low-level discovery] (LLD).
2. Send a metric item/value pair to a [Zabbix trapper].

![Zabbix](assets/zabbix.png)

To create an appropriate discovery host, in Zabbix:
- Configuration->Hosts->Create host (`mqttwarn01`)
- Configuration->Discovery->Create discovery rule
  - Name: `MQTTwarn` (any suitable name)
  - Type: `Zabbix trapper`
  - Key: `mqtt.discovery` (this must match the configured `discovery_key`, which defaults to `mqtt.discovery`)
  - Allowed hosts: `192.168.1.130,127.0.0.1` (example)

The target and topic configuration look like this:

```ini
[config:zabbix]
host = "mqttwarn01"  # an existing host configured in Zabbix
discovery_key = "mqtt.discovery"
targets = {
            # Trapper address   port
    't1'  : [ '172.16.153.110', 10051 ],
  }

[zabbix/clients/+]
alldata = ZabbixData()
targets = zabbix:t1

[zabbix/item/#]
alldata = ZabbixData()
targets = zabbix:t1
```

A transformation function in `alldata` is required to extract the client's name
from the topic, and for #1, to define a "host alive" item key in [Zabbix].

```python
# If the topic begins with zabbix/clients we have a host going up or down
# e.g. "zabbix/clients/jog03" -> "jog03"
#   extract client name (3rd part of topic)
#   set status key (e.g. 'host.up') to publish 1/0 on it (e.g during LWT)
#
# if the topic starts with zabbix/item we have an item/value for the host
# e.g. "zabbix/item/jog03/time.stamp" -> "jog03"
#   extract client name (3rd part of topic)
#

def ZabbixData(topic, data, srv=None):
    client = 'unknown'
    key = None
    status_key = None

    parts = topic.split('/')

    ''' What we call 'client' is in fact a "Zabbix Host", i.e. the name of a
        host configured with items; it it not the name/address of the machine on
        which Zabbix server runs. So, in the UI: Configuration -> Create host '''

    client = parts[2]

    if topic.startswith('zabbix/clients/'):
        status_key = 'host.up'

    ''' This "key" is actually an LLD item which we've pre-created in the Zabbix
        UI. Configuration->Hosts->Discovery->Item prototypes->Create item prototype
	   Name: MW client $1
	   Type: Zabbix trapper
	   Key: mqttwarn.id[{#MQTTHOST}]
	   Type: text (can be any suitable type)

	Publishing a value with
	$ mosquitto_pub -t zabbix/item/mqttwarn01/mqttwarn.id[m02] -m 'stormy'
	will mean that we'll use the client "mqttwarn01" (see previously) and
	the item named "mqttwarn.id[m02]" which is the name of a previously
	discovered item.
    '''

    if topic.startswith('zabbix/item/'):
        key = parts[3]

    return dict(client=client, key=key, status_key=status_key)
```

For another scenario using the `zabbix` plugin, please refer to the [Zabbix IoT example].
