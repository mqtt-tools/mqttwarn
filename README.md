# mqtt2pushover

This program subscribes to any number of MQTT topics (including wildcards) and publishes received payloads to [pushover.net](https://pushover.net).

You associate topic branches to application keys (pushover terminology) in the configuration file (copy `mqtt2pushover.conf.sample` to `mqtt2pushover.conf` for use). 

See details in the config sample for how to configure this script.
